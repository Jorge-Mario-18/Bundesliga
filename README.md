Hello!
 
 Here I demonstrate the relationship of having a high rate of possession will result in more 
goals scored using data from Germany's top tier football league, the Bundesliga. 

I pulled data during the 2020-2021 season for four teams: Bayern Munich(1st), Borussia Dortmund(2nd), 
Eintracht Frankfurt(12th and winner of the Europa League), and Greuther FÃ¼rth(18th and relegated). 

I used data for each game played for each team, possession and goals in favor (goals scored). 
I removed any outliers in the data such as games that ended in penalties and a game where Bayern Munich scored 12 goals. 

I've compiled all of the games played by each team and compared what their possesions were vs how many goals they scored. 
I also presented the averages of each team in terms of possessions vs goals scored. 

It's important to recognize that Bayern Munich as a whole is an outlier 
comapred to the rest of the Bundesliga as they have a huge financial advantage and are the winners of the last 10 Bundesliga seasons.  
I did want to included them as a comparison to the rest of the teams in the league. 

I provided all of the cvs files for the four teams courtsey of SportsReference.com. The first part of the project is the python script
which pulls the necessary data and make the master csv file, bundesliga21.csv. 

The second part is the r file which creates the charts and calculates the averages for each team. 

I hope you enjoyed my project and if your new to football/soccer, I hope I've shared some new insight into the sport!
